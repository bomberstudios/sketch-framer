# Sketch Framer

![](logo_small.png?raw=true)

A plugin to export [Sketch.app](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch) documents into [FramerJS](http://framerjs.com) to make interactive prototypes.

**Not ready for general consumption yet**, but if you're a developer, here's how to get the code and help us make it better.

See <https://vimeo.com/67393477> for a sneak peek :)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository. Open *Terminal* and type:
```
cd ~/
git clone git@github.com:bomberstudios/sketch-framer.git
```

2. Download the [Beta version of Sketch](http://www.bohemiancoding.com/sketch/beta/)
3. Enable scripting in Sketch by going to *Preferences > General* and clicking the *Enable Scripting* button.
4. In Terminal go to `~/Library/Application Support/sketch/Plugins` (Create these directories if they don't exist)
6. Type `ln -s "~/sketch-framer/sketch-plugin/Sketch Framer" "./Sketch Framer"`
7. Now you should see the option in your Plugins menu.

## Tips
* Every group in your document will export as individual Framer Views. To have a group flattened so its child groups don't export individually, append `*` to its name. Example: `Card*`
* Every non-group piece of art (for ex. a shape or text layer) will export as a flat image along with its parent group. If you want to turn such a shape into a Framer View, append `+` to its name. Example: `Shape+`
* To ignore a layer, either hide it in Sketch, or append `-` to its name. Example: `Ignored-`
* Multiple artboards work funky. Ideally don't have any artboards in the document, and make sure the top left of all your contents align to (0,0)
* Masks currently don't work. Workaround: flatten the group that includes a mask (by appending `*` to its name).
